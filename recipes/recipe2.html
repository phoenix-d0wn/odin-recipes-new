    <p>The definition of a cozy, flavorful, hearty dump meal.</p>

    <p> The humble rice cooker is finally getting the recognition it deserves for being the fantastic kitchen workhorse that it is. This may come as a surprise, but even though it’s called a rice cooker, it doesn’t mean it only cooks rice. In fact, you can make an entire meal in your rice cooker, and some of them, like the KitchenAid rice and grain cooker, go so far as to cook beans, too. Cooking with this appliance is really just as easy as any slow cooker meal. </p>

    <p>
    If you’re looking to try an easy dump meal in your rice cooker, this flavorful dish with sausage, peppers, and rice is the perfect weeknight option. </p>
