    <h1>Easy Chicken and Stuffing Bake</h1>

    <img src="../images/recipe1.jpg" alt="image of chicen and stuffing bake">
    <p>This easy chicken and stuffing bake is comfort in a casserole. The chicken is tender and juicy, the stuffing topping contrasts with the creamy sauce, and the added onion soup mix brings so much flavor. A little bit of parsley on top is a nice bright note.</p>

                </li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish and arrange chicken in a single layer. </li>
            <li> Stir soup, sour cream, and onion soup mix together in a bowl and spread evenly over chicken. Sprinkle with pepper.   </li>
            <li> Combine stuffing mix and chicken broth in a bowl. Spread stuffing mixture over chicken and top with pats of butter. </li>
            <li> Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, and chicken is no longer pink at the center, 50 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
            <li> Let stand 10 minutes; sprinkle with parsley. To serve, place chicken and stuffing on individual plates and spoon over about 1/4 cup of gravy from the casserole dish. </li>
        </ol>
